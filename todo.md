  - [x] Set up a basic server using Express.js.
  - [x] Configure environment variables using the `dotenv` package.

## 2. User Authentication Module

- [x] **Implement User Registration and Login Functionality**

  - [x] Create a user registration endpoint (`POST /register`).
  - [x] Create a user login endpoint (`POST /login`).
  - [x] Validate user input for registration and login.

- [x] **Set Up Password Hashing and Secure Storage**

  - [x] Install and configure the `bcrypt` package for password hashing.
  - [x] Hash passwords before storing them in the database.
  - [x] Implement password verification during login.

- [x] **Implement JWT-Based Authentication**
  - [x] Install and configure the `jsonwebtoken` package.
  - [x] Generate JWT tokens upon successful login.
  - [x] Implement middleware to protect routes requiring authentication.

## 3. AI Integration for Recipe Generation

- [x] **Research and Select an Appropriate AI Model**

  - [x] Evaluate AI models capable of generating recipes based on user input.
  - [x] Select an AI model that balances performance and cost.

- [x] **Integrate the AI Model into the Backend**

  - [x] Set up API calls to interact with the chosen AI model.
  - [x] Implement error handling for AI interactions.

- [x] **Develop Recipe Generation Endpoint**
  - [x] Create an endpoint (`POST /generate-recipe`) to handle user prompts.
  - [x] Process user input and pass it to the AI model.
  - [x] Return the generated recipe to the user.

## 4. Recipe Management System

- [x] **Set Up Database Schema for Recipes**

  - [x] Design a database schema to store recipe details.
  - [x] Implement models for recipe data.

- [x] **Implement CRUD Operations for Recipe Management**

  - [x] Create endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting recipes.
  - [x] Implement validation and error handling for recipe data.
  - [x] Ensure that only authenticated users can perform CRUD operations on their own recipes.

- [x] **Develop Functionality to Categorize Recipes**
  - [x] Implement a system to assign categories to recipes.
  - [x] Create endpoints to retrieve recipes by category.
  - [x] Ensure that categories are predefined and cannot be modified by users.

## 5. Frontend Development

- [x] **Set Up the Frontend Framework**

  - [x] Initialize a new React.js project.
  - [x] Install necessary dependencies (e.g., React Router, Axios).
  - [x] Set up routing for different pages (e.g., Home, Login, Register, Recipe Management).

- [x] **Develop User Interfaces for Registration, Login, and Recipe Management**

  - [x] Create a registration form with fields for email and password.
  - [x] Create a login form with fields for email and password.
  - [x] Develop a dashboard for authenticated users to manage their recipes.

- [ ] **Implement Forms for Recipe Generation and Filtering**
  - [ ] Create a form to input prompts for AI-generated recipes.
  - [ ] Implement checkboxes or dropdowns for users to specify dietary preferences.
  - [ ] Display generated recipes with options to save them to the user's collection.

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Write Unit Tests for Backend Modules**

  - [ ] Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest).
  - [ ] Write tests for user authentication endpoints.
  - [ ] Write tests for recipe management endpoints.

- [ ] **Write Unit Tests for Frontend Components**

  - [ ] Set up a testing library (e.g., React Testing Library).
  - [ ] Write tests for registration and login forms.
  - [ ] Write tests for recipe management components.

- [ ] **Conduct Integration Testing for End-to-End Workflows**
  - [ ] Test the complete user registration and login process.
  - [ ] Test the end-to-end recipe generation and saving process.
  - [ ] Ensure that all components work together seamlessly.

## 7. Deployment Preparation

- [ ] **Set Up a Staging Environment for Testing**

  - [ ] Configure a staging server that mirrors the production environment.
  - [ ] Deploy the application to the staging environment.
  - [ ] Perform end-to-end testing in the staging environment.

- [ ] **Prepare for Production Deployment**

  - [ ] Optimize the application for production (e.g., minify code, set environment variables).
  - [ ] Set up a production server.
  - [ ] Deploy the application to the production server.

- [ ] **Monitor and Maintain the Application**
  - [ ] Implement logging and monitoring to track application performance and errors.
  - [ ] Set up alerts for critical issues.
  - [ ] Plan for regular updates and maintenance.
