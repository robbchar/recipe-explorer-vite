# AI-Powered Recipe Website Development Checklist

## 1. Initial Setup and Configuration

- [ ] **Initialize the Project Repository and Set Up Version Control**

  - [x] Create a new Git repository for the project.
  - [x] Set up a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files.
  - [ ] Commit the initial project structure to the repository.

- [ ] **Configure the Development Environment**
  - [ ] Install Node.js and verify the installation.
  - [ ] Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`.
  - [ ] Install essential dependencies (e.g., Express.js, dotenv).
  - [ ] Set up a basic server using Express.js.
  - [ ] Configure environment variables using the `dotenv` package.

## 2. User Authentication Module

- [ ] **Implement User Registration and Login Functionality**

  - [ ] Create a user registration endpoint (`POST /register`).
  - [ ] Create a user login endpoint (`POST /login`).
  - [ ] Validate user input for registration and login.

- [ ] **Set Up Password Hashing and Secure Storage**

  - [ ] Install and configure the `bcrypt` package for password hashing.
  - [ ] Hash passwords before storing them in the database.
  - [ ] Implement password verification during login.

- [ ] **Implement JWT-Based Authentication**
  - [ ] Install and configure the `jsonwebtoken` package.
  - [ ] Generate JWT tokens upon successful login.
  - [ ] Implement middleware to protect routes requiring authentication.

## 3. AI Integration for Recipe Generation

- [ ] **Research and Select an Appropriate AI Model**

  - [ ] Evaluate AI models capable of generating recipes based on user input.
  - [ ] Select an AI model that balances performance and cost.

- [ ] **Integrate the AI Model into the Backend**

  - [ ] Set up API calls to interact with the chosen AI model.
  - [ ] Implement error handling for AI interactions.

- [ ] **Develop Recipe Generation Endpoint**
  - [ ] Create an endpoint (`POST /generate-recipe`) to handle user prompts.
  - [ ] Process user input and pass it to the AI model.
  - [ ] Return the generated recipe to the user.

## 4. Recipe Management System

- [ ] **Set Up Database Schema for Recipes**

  - [ ] Design a database schema to store recipe details.
  - [ ] Implement models for recipe data.

- [ ] **Implement CRUD Operations for Recipe Management**

  - [ ] Create endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting recipes.
  - [ ] Implement validation and error handling for recipe data.
  - [ ] Ensure that only authenticated users can perform CRUD operations on their own recipes.

- [ ] **Develop Functionality to Categorize Recipes**
  - [ ] Implement a system to assign categories to recipes.
  - [ ] Create endpoints to retrieve recipes by category.
  - [ ] Ensure that categories are predefined and cannot be modified by users.

## 5. Frontend Development

- [ ] **Set Up the Frontend Framework**

  - [ ] Initialize a new React.js project.
  - [ ] Install necessary dependencies (e.g., React Router, Axios).
  - [ ] Set up routing for different pages (e.g., Home, Login, Register, Recipe Management).

- [ ] **Develop User Interfaces for Registration, Login, and Recipe Management**

  - [ ] Create a registration form with fields for email and password.
  - [ ] Create a login form with fields for email and password.
  - [ ] Develop a dashboard for authenticated users to manage their recipes.

- [ ] **Implement Forms for Recipe Generation and Filtering**
  - [ ] Create a form to input prompts for AI-generated recipes.
  - [ ] Implement checkboxes or dropdowns for users to specify dietary preferences.
  - [ ] Display generated recipes with options to save them to the user's collection.

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Write Unit Tests for Backend Modules**

  - [ ] Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest).
  - [ ] Write tests for user authentication endpoints.
  - [ ] Write tests for recipe management endpoints.

- [ ] **Write Unit Tests for Frontend Components**

  - [ ] Set up a testing library (e.g., React Testing Library).
  - [ ] Write tests for registration and login forms.
  - [ ] Write tests for recipe management components.

- [ ] **Conduct Integration Testing for End-to-End Workflows**
  - [ ] Test the complete user registration and login process.
  - [ ] Test the end-to-end recipe generation and saving process.
  - [ ] Ensure that all components work together seamlessly.

## 7. Deployment Preparation

- [ ] **Set Up a Staging Environment for Testing**

  - [ ] Configure a staging server that mirrors the production environment.
  - [ ] Deploy the application to the staging environment.
  - [ ] Perform end-to-end testing in the staging environment.

- [ ] **Prepare for Production Deployment**

  - [ ] Optimize the application for production (e.g., minify code, set environment variables).
  - [ ] Set up a production server.
  - [ ] Deploy the application to the production server.

- [ ] **Monitor and Maintain the Application**
  - [ ] Implement logging and monitoring to track application performance and errors.
  - [ ] Set up alerts for critical issues.
  - [ ] Plan for regular updates and maintenance.
