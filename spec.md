## 1. Project Overview

The AI-Powered Recipe Website enables users to generate, store, and retrieve personalized recipes. Inspired by meal kit services like HelloFresh, the platform focuses on individual user experiences without social sharing features. A key component is the integration of AI to assist users in creating custom recipes based on general or detailed prompts.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

- **User Accounts and Authentication**

  - Users can register and log in using their email addresses.
  - Passwords must be securely hashed and stored.

- **AI-Powered Recipe Generation**

  - Users can input general prompts (e.g., "pasta dish with chicken") to generate recipes.
  - Optional filters allow refinement based on dietary preferences and cuisine types.

- **Recipe Management**
  - Users can save generated recipes to their accounts.
  - Recipes can be organized into predefined categories (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts).
  - Users can view, edit, and delete their saved recipes.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**

  - The system should handle multiple concurrent users efficiently.
  - Recipe generation responses should be delivered within a reasonable time frame.

- **Scalability**

  - The architecture should allow for easy scaling as the user base grows.

- **Security**
  - User data, especially authentication credentials, must be securely handled.
  - Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 System Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture:

- **Frontend:** A responsive web application where users interact with the platform.
- **Backend:** RESTful API handling user authentication, recipe generation requests, and data management.
- **AI Service:** An external AI API integrated into the backend for recipe generation.

### 3.2 Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React.js)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database:** SQLite for initial development; potential migration to PostgreSQL or MySQL for scalability
- **AI Integration:** Integration with an existing AI-powered recipe generation API

## 4. Data Management

### 4.1 Database Schema

**Users Table**

- `id` (INTEGER, Primary Key)
- `email` (TEXT, Unique, Not Null)
- `password_hash` (TEXT, Not Null)
- `created_at` (DATETIME, Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

**Recipes Table**

- `id` (INTEGER, Primary Key)
- `user_id` (INTEGER, Foreign Key referencing Users(id))
- `title` (TEXT, Not Null)
- `ingredients` (TEXT, Not Null)
- `instructions` (TEXT, Not Null)
- `category` (TEXT, Not Null)
- `created_at` (DATETIME, Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

### 4.2 Data Storage

- **Development Phase:** Utilize SQLite for its simplicity and ease of integration with Node.js.
- **Production Phase:** Monitor database performance and consider migrating to PostgreSQL or MySQL as the application scales.

## 5. Error Handling

### 5.1 Error Types

- **User Input Errors:** Invalid data provided by the user (e.g., incorrect login credentials).
- **Server Errors:** Issues arising from server malfunctions or exceptions.
- **External Service Errors:** Failures in communication with the AI API or other third-party services.

### 5.2 Error Handling Strategies

- **Synchronous Operations:** Use `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Implement `.catch()` for Promises or use `try-catch` within async/await functions.
- **Centralized Error Middleware:** In Express.js, create middleware to handle errors uniformly across the application.
- **Logging:** Record errors with sufficient context to facilitate debugging and issue resolution.

## 6. Testing Plan

### 6.1 Unit Testing

- **Scope:** Test individual functions and components, such as user authentication and recipe generation logic.
- **Tools:** Utilize testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha.

### 6.2 Integration Testing

- **Scope:** Test interactions between different modules and external services, including AI API integration.
- **Tools:** Use Supertest in conjunction with the unit testing framework to test API endpoints.

### 6.3 End-to-End Testing

- **Scope:** Simulate user interactions to ensure the system functions correctly from the user's perspective.
- **Tools:** Employ tools like Cypress or Selenium.

## 7. Deployment Considerations

- **Hosting Environment:** Choose a provider that supports Node.js applications and the selected database system.
- **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials, in environment variables.
- **Scalability:** Design the deployment architecture to allow for scaling, such as using load balancers and containerization technologies like Docker.

## 8. Future Enhancements

- **Custom Tagging:** Allow users to add personalized tags to their recipes for improved organization.
- **Household Accounts:** Enable multiple users to share and collaborate on recipes within a household.
- **Social Features:** Introduce options for users to share recipes with friends or the broader community.
- **Mobile Application:** Develop a mobile app to provide users with on-the-go access to their recipes.
