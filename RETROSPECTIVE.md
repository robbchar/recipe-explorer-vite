## 1. Project Overview

Recipe Explorer is a full-stack web application that enables users to generate, manage, and organize recipes using AI assistance. The project was developed using AI pair programming, demonstrating the effectiveness of human-AI collaboration in modern software development.

## 2. Implemented Features

### 2.1 AI Recipe Generation

- Integration with Google's Vertex AI for recipe generation
- Support for customizable prompts including:
  - Ingredient preferences
  - Dietary restrictions
  - Cuisine types
  - Meal types
  - Difficulty levels

### 2.2 Recipe Management

- Complete CRUD operations for recipes
- Category-based organization
- Tag-based organization
- Support for detailed recipe information:
  - Title
  - Ingredients with amounts and units
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Preparation time
  - Cooking time
  - Serving size
  - Difficulty level

### 2.3 User Authentication

- Email-based authentication
- Secure password handling
- Protected routes and endpoints
- User-specific recipe collections

### 2.4 User Interface

- Responsive web design
- Dashboard for recipe management
- Recipe generation interface
- Category-based recipe browsing

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**

  - Vite for build tooling
  - React for UI components
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - React Router for navigation
  - Tailwind CSS for styling

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js with Express
  - TypeScript
  - Prisma ORM
  - SQLite database
  - Google Vertex AI SDK

### 3.2 Key Architecture Decisions

#### Database Schema

- Implemented using Prisma with relations between:
  - Users and Recipes (one-to-many)
  - Recipes and Ingredients (many-to-many)
  - Recipes and Tags (many-to-many)
  - Recipes and Categories (many-to-many)

#### API Structure

- RESTful architecture
- Controller-based organization
- Middleware for authentication and error handling
- Transaction support for complex operations

#### AI Integration

- Asynchronous recipe generation
- Structured prompt formatting
- Error handling for AI service failures
- Response parsing and validation

## 4. Development Learnings

### 4.1 Successful Patterns

- **Transaction Handling:**

  - Using Prisma transactions for atomic operations
  - Proper error handling and rollback support
  - Effective mocking in tests

- **Testing Strategy:**

  - Comprehensive unit tests for controllers
  - Mock implementations for external services
  - Transaction testing patterns

- **Error Handling:**
  - Centralized error handling middleware
  - Consistent error response format
  - Proper error logging

### 4.2 Challenges and Solutions

#### Testing Complex Operations

- **Challenge:** Mocking Prisma transactions in tests
- **Solution:** Implemented flexible mock that handles both function and array-based transactions

#### Type Safety

- **Challenge:** Maintaining type safety across the full stack
- **Solution:** Leveraged TypeScript and Prisma's generated types

#### AI Integration

- **Challenge:** Handling AI service timeouts and errors
- **Solution:** Implemented robust error handling and user feedback

### 4.3 AI Pair Programming Insights

- Effective for:
  - Debugging complex issues
  - Writing test cases
  - Implementing best practices
  - Maintaining consistent code style

## 5. Setup Guide

### 5.1 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- Google Cloud account for Vertex AI

### 5.2 Environment Variables

Use the env.example file.

### 5.3 Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
4. Start the development servers:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### 5.4 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test

# Run specific test file
npm run test:watch
```
